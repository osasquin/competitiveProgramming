# Competitive Programming

This repository is to store my solutions to various competitive programming exercises. I use many plataforms to practice and improve my programming skills. Besides them, there is a selection of problems for the college discipline of Marathon-Programming (Maratona de Programação) at the Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI).
