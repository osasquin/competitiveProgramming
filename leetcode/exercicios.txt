1️⃣ Arrays: Data structures, such as arrays, store elements in contiguous memory locations. They are versatile and useful for a wide variety of purposes.

LeetCode Problems:

- Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Problem #33)
- Product of Array Except Self (Problem #238)
- Find the Missing Number (Problem #268)

2️⃣Two Pointers: In Two Pointers, two pointers are maintained in the collection and can be manipulated to solve a problem efficiently.

LeetCode problems:

- Trapping Rain Water (Problem #42)
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Problem #3)
- Squares of a Sorted Array (Problem #977)

3️⃣In-place Linked List Traversal: As an explanation, in-place traversal is a technique for modifying linked list nodes without using extra space.

LeetCode Problems:

- Remove Nth Node From End of List (Problem #19)
- Palindrome Linked List (Problem #234)
- Reorder List (Problem #143)

4️⃣Fast & Slow Pointers: This pattern uses two pointers to traverse a sequence at different speeds (fast and slow), often used to detect cycles or find a specific position in the sequence.

LeetCode Problems:

- Happy Number (Problem #202)
- Subarray Sum Equals K (Problem #560)
- Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Problem #160)

5️⃣Merge Intervals: This pattern involves merging overlapping intervals in a collection, often used in problems dealing with intervals or ranges.

LeetCode problems:

- Non-overlapping Intervals (Problem #435)
- Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons (Problem #452)
- Employee Free Time (Problem #759)
